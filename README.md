# Hello!

### That's my first GitHub Pages repository.

---

I am the first-year student of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.
Currently working on a project with 5 of my colleagues called *PyChess* - as you could guess, we are writing a program for playing chess using Python.

### PyChess

After almost 3 months of working to complete all the tasks connected with *PyChess* project, I am content to announce our entire team succeeded in finishing them! 

I've learnt many things through this experience which I will surely find helpful in the future. Not only about the tools, but mostly about the team work. 

Check out our *PyChess* repository:
